<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The QGIS plugin "Quiz" reads the data-format GIFT used by moodle and supports different question types (see below).
It works on its own, it hardly interacts with QGIS and doesnt need an internet connection at all.
However, it logs quiz scores and stores the for evaluation (in schools etc).
</p>
<p>Here a couple of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quizzes are used primarily in geography classes, either for lecture-relevant topics or to get to know QGIS itself.</li>
<li>The plugin can be used for students to do tests or to practice / train.</li>
<li>A lecturer can discuss questions, while pupils follow him in trainig mode.</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions can be used to do surveys in classes.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Following software supports editing GIFT-files:<p>
<ul>
<li>LibreOffice Writer with Templates (Hot Potatoes Homepage)</li>
<li>MS Excel with Makros</li>
<li>Moodle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quiz Syntax</h3>

<p>A quiz consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An optional //Title: block, which sets the title of the quiz</li>
<li>An optional //Instruction: block, which sets instructions for the quiz</li>
<li>An arbitrary amount of question-blocks, which have to be one of the following: <br>
<ul>
<li>Picture Question:<br>
A picture is displayed, along with a question with multiple possible answers regarding it. The picture must be in png format, has to be named the same as the correct answer, and should reside in the /quizzes/images directory. 
</li>
<li>
Text Question:<br>
A simple text question with exactly one correct answer
</li>
<li>
Multiple Choice Question:<br>
Text question with multiple possible correct answers, that all can have individual weightage.
</li>
<li>
Matching Question:<br>
A question / instruction, followed by two rows of elements, of which always two have to be matched together.
</li>
<li>
Fill In The Gap Question:<br>
A fill in the gap question with an arbitrary amount of gaps that have to be filled.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These blocks have to be seperated by an empty line from eachother. When the quiz is created, one can open it via the plugin. For an example of a quiz with all question types look below.
</p>
<h3>Instruction for creating a quiz</h3>
<p>
Goal of this instruction is to create an own quiz using opensource software. After finishing, one can either use the quiz in moodle or in QGIS.
</p>

<h4>The typical workflow of creating a quiz is:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prepare software</li>
<li>Creating the quiz</li>
<li>Testing the quiz</li>
<li>Publishing the quiz</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
A programming- or normal text-editor can be used to create a quiz. There are templates for creating quizzes in LibreOffice<br>
Additional preparation is not necessary. 
</p>

<h4>Infos:</h4>
<p>
The question types are all also described in this <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/GIFT">GIFT-Documentation</a>
</p>

<h4>Creating a quiz</h4>
<p>
Use a simple editor to write a quiz.
</p>

<h4>Testing a quiz</h4>
<p>
Use this plugin or the Moodle-platform to test your quiz. 
</p>

<h4>Quiz publizieren</h4>
<p>
Load your quiz to this <a href="http://giswiki.hsr.ch/QGIS_Quiz_Plugin">Wiki-page</a>
